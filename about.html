        <h2>Education is a basic human right.</h2>
        <p class="aboutP">The reason students are identified as Gifted and Talented are because their brains are wired so that how we learn and what we do with the content is different from those who are not identified. However, besides identifying students, the education system has neglected GT student needs. This lack of support has negatively impacted GT studentsâ€™ education. Often,the GT curriculum is left up to school and district boards to decide, and those on the boards are not familiar with how GT students work, resulting in the lack of funding and focus on the GT curriculum. Educational board members have the responsibilty to care for GT students as much as they do for non-identified students.</p>
